## Introduction

JavaScript is the most popular language for web development. It allows you to build interactive and dynamic websites. Here’s the first piece of code to get started:


```js
// This is a simple JavaScript program
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
let greeting = "Hello World"; // String
let score = 100; // Number
let isCompleted = true; // Boolean

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]; // Array
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // Object

console.log(typeof greeting); // Output: string
console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: Banana
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
```
